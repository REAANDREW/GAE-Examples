Google App Engine Examples - Using the Django Framework

Author : Andrew Rea


I am writing these examples as I get familiar with working with the Google App Engine in python.  I thought it would be very handy to have these on github for future reference.  Hopefully it might be of interest or use to others.


[ Simple Contact Form ]

This is example simply adds a contact form to the page and saves the post data as an enquiry.

[ Simple Contact Form using the Google App Engine Task Queue ]

This is similar to the first example, only the processing of of the post data is off set to the task handler

[ Simple Forum ]

This is a simple forum, as the name suggests to achieve core functionality that a forum should have.  In this example I will also be looking at authentication, and querying with the Google App Engine Data Store.  The authentication provider I will be using for this will be the Google App Engine OpenID support.  There is a subtle difference to what you will see when on the GAE Cloud as you do when you are developing.
